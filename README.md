# Video Recording: record-pi.py

This script captures video from a Raspberry Pi camera (it can be adjusted to use a USB camera) and saves the recorded videos to the specified folder in .MP4 format.

Parameters:

- output_dir (default: "recorded") – the directory where recorded videos will be saved.

- frame_size (default: (1280, 720)) – the resolution of the recorded video frames.

Output:

Video files will be saved in .MP4 format.

Example usage:

- output_dir = "recorded"
- frame_size = (1280, 720)
